# Covid-19-Risk-Calculator

This project uses machine learning algorithm to determine the covid 19 risk at the county level using various other datasets like vaccinations data,mobility data,population density data etc. The project is in development and more insights will be updated here with the progress in development.
We would like to thank the providers of our dataset without which this project could not have been possible. We would like to thank Google LLC for the open mobility datasets,US Centre of Disease Control And Prevention(CDC) for the vaccinations dataset and The New York Times for the covid cases dataset.
